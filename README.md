# SWE1-MTCG
A java based trading-card game.
https://github.com/h3ight/SWE1-MTCG

est. total time spent: 4 weeks

Project has been built from scratch atleast once due to a change of internal code structure (creating Enums instead of dividing monsters/spells into their own classes).
Main reason for that was to spend less time on figuring out confusing code that hasnt been worked on for a while.

REST Server included, but not functional.

One Unit test first used to test a card being saved onto a deck successfully.
